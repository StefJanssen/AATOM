These Matlab scripts and functions can be used to import and analyze data generated by AATOM. 

To use these scripts, run the importAndVisualize script and select the FOLDER that contains the log files of a simulation run. So for instance, select logfiles/1503561764574_9956_111111, and not logfiles/1503561764574_9956_111111/agentTrace.txt.
